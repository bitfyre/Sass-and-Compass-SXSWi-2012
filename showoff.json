{"name":"Simplify CSS Development with Sass & Compass","description":"Simplify and speed up your CSS development with Sass. Overcome browser differences – particularly with CSS3 – and build grids the right way with Compass. Sass is a CSS meta language that brings more functional programming to the css language and complies to standard browser supported CSS. It adds tools like variables, functions, and mixins, as well as compilation tools for debugging and optimization. Compass builds an additional framework of tools on top of Sass. It adds mixins for almost all the new CSS3 modules to abstract away syntax inconsistencies and browser prefixes. It also enables the development of CSS frameworks *the right way*, using semantic classes instead of presentation oriented classes. Compass has ports Frameworks like Blueprint, YUI, 960.gs, as well as even some Compass only ones like Susy. On top of that, there are also loads of extensions to Compass for everything from CSS3 button generators to more complex sprite and image generators.","author":"Alex Lemanski","sections":[{"section":"intro"},{"section":"basics"},{"section":"tools"},{"section":"rebuke"}]}
